<H2>5. What makes you think youâ€™ll succeed as a coder? </H2>


<p>What would make a good coder? I believe coding is a language and to speak it you will need to first understand it; so that you can solve problems or viruses if one creates any. To be a very good programmer, a coder must have enough information. Of course, one component to maintain in mind is that there can by no means be a lack of awareness required for programming, and one should continually attempt to have greater knowledge out of the necessary know-how in oneself. There is no stop to gaining knowledge. The extra you research, the greater you benefit.</p>

<P>Professional coders are clever, hardworking, devoted, trustworthy, and resilient. Do I believe I tick the boxes on each of the points mentioned above? Definitely! Although there is always room for improvement. I am willing to commit to an ongoing profession in coding since I've had a taste of what programming could be in High school. I am open and keen to learn more about coding. Coders should be able to problem-solve and I believe I can do so. I would like to be able to successfully code and lead projects in the future. </P>


<P>To add to the many skills that a coder should have are: Self Reliance is very crucial. As a person, I can trust my instinct and I am open to trying out different solutions to either make my work easier or solve a problem. Do I have a basic understanding of a computer? Indeed I took Computer Application Technology in High School and many others believe a good coder should understand the basics of a computer. Lastly, a good coder should have Perseverance. Tracking down and solving software bugs is a massive part of a coder's life. it is also one of the most irritating aspects of the job. I can motivate myself until I have located the bug and fixed it, therefore I can succeed in coding.</p>
